inquiry, (input a text or voice describing the statues and complaints of a patient --> the entities are retrieved from the text and distribute to different entity labels, these missing labels not detected in the text for example like patient weight or past history are further asked to users for completion )

inspection, (give recommendation tests)

diagnosis, (give the possible diseases ranking)

medication & treatment, (all the results from previous steps are input to the treatment and prognosis process and thus give final suggestion)
